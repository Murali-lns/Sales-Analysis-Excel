# Sales Data Excel Project

## Overview
This project leverages Microsoft Excel to analyze sales data and uncover key business insights. By cleaning, preparing, and visualizing data, I identified product, revenue, and customer trends that impact business decisions.

> **Tools Used:** Microsoft Excel (2023)

   - Calculated averages, totals, and discovered top performing categories.

3. **Visualization & Dashboards**
